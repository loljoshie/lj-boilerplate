## Recommended IDE Setup
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Features
* Vite for fast, modern builds
* Vue for a powerful and intuitive UI development experience
* TailwindCSS for easy, customizable styling
* Customizable configuration options
* Lightweight and easy to use

## Getting Started
To get started with using this boilerplate, follow these steps:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Open the main directory of the cloned repository in your preferred editor.
* CD into the "web" folder in your terminal by running `cd web`.
```sh
cd web
```
* Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
```sh
npm install
```

![cd web npm install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91661118/233503622-4a8a847d-80d4-441c-8e72-458851ad3531.gif)

## Usage
To use this boilerplate, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development:
Use the following command to start the development server with hot-reload enabled:

```sh
npm run dev
```

![dev](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91661118/233505518-195efbab-6e65-481c-939f-826eb4c9c76f.gif)

This will compile the Vue.js files and start a local server that you can access in your browser. Any changes you make to the files will be automatically recompiled and the browser will refresh to show the changes.

#### Compile for Production:
Use the following command to compile the Vue.js files for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

![build](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91661118/233505563-0dfecd20-dcea-4f6f-a127-e1dcf4163422.gif)

This will compile the files and create an `html` folder that contains the output. Once you've loaded compiled it successfully, you can now access your project in-game.

## Dark mode
Now that dark mode is a first-class feature of many operating systems, it’s becoming more and more common to design a dark version of your website to go along with the default design.

To make this as easy as possible, Tailwind includes a `dark` variant that lets you style your site differently when dark mode is enabled:

* Launch your preferred editor and access the main directory of the cloned repository.
* Locate and open the src folder within the directory.
* Navigate to the index.html file located inside the src folder.
* Toggle between the `dark` or `light` mode as desired.

## Boilerplate Upgrade (optional)
TailwindCSS has also developed a handful of official plugins for popular features that for one reason or another don’t belong in core yet.

* ```npm install -D tailwindcss-animate```
* ```npm install -D @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio```
* ```npm install @headlessui/vue@latest```
* ```npm install @heroicons/vue```
* ```npm install -D @tailwindcss/forms```
* ```npm i @tailwindcss/typography```
